## Preparation Strategy

1. **Understand the Case Studies**: You will likely see questions referencing the EHR Healthcare, Helicopter Racing League, Mountkirk Games, and TerramEarth case studies. Know them inside out.
2. **Hands-on Experience**: There is no substitute for actual experience. Use the Google Cloud Free Tier to build the solutions described in the case studies.

- **Storage**: Selecting the appropriate storage class and type based on performance and cost.
- **Operations**: Monitoring, logging, and debugging with Google Cloud's operations suite.
